Car Consumption App.

This app was developed for the Coursera Developing Data Products Course's Project.
It predicts the Car Consumption (in MPG) based on its weight, number of cyclinders, horsepower and the type of transmission.

Prediction Model: mtcars dataset.

The app is hosted on [ShinyApps.io](https://xvitorlopes.shinyapps.io/DataProducts_Project)

The R Presentation is available at [RPubs](http://rpubs.com/vitorlopes/DataProducts_Project).

Source code for ui.R and server.R files are available in my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/xvitorlopes/DataProducts_Project).
